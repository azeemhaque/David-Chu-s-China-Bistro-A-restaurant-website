# A website for a restaurant made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

As a part of this course offered by Coursera, I started from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. Then I advanced to learn how to code the pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. I was then able to code up a web page that would be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, I got a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, I was able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.
